1. See the foll. tutorial:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvg9oUHtX50
    
    -- Get the general idea of binomial distribution
    -- Understand P(X= x) = nCx ( p^x * q^(n-x) ) by intuition, no proof required as formula can be is understood logically
    
2. Derive mean and variance formula from Probability Distribution formula above 
     https://www.probabilisticworld.com/binomial-distribution-mean-variance-formulas-proof/

       -- u = np  -- mean formula
       -- sigma^2 = npq  -- variance formula
