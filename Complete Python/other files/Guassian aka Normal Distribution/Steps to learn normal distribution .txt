1. Brush up the definition of mean median and mode

    The mean (average) of a data set is found by adding all numbers in the data set and then dividing by the number of values in the set. The median is the middle value when a data set is ordered from least to greatest. The mode is the number that occurs most often in a data set.

2. See the foll. tutorial:

    -- Understand that mean = median in Normal Distribution
    -- Normal Distribution is the general distribution pattern followed by many data across various fields
    -- Normal Distribution is the blue-print followed by many data collected.
    -- Understand the last part carefully where the practical application of Normal Distribution is given, 

3.See the foll. tutorial:

    -- Understand the meaning of graph of Normal Distribution:
        -- 1 sigma(i.e. std deviation) in graph is simply 
            "std deviation = 1"
        -- pay attention to part 0:30 to 3:30

    -- Z score, for a given data point x, tells how many std deviations is x away from the mean -- relate with formula
    -- probability chart for z- scores
        -- different charts for +ve and -ve z-scores
        -- The leftmost column and uppermost row represent the z-score and the interior numbers are z-score associated probability values
        -- probability chart always gives probability P(Z< z-score) i.e probability of z-score and below that 
        (see example in tutorial for clarity )
    
4. Question from Course:
    --Assume the average weight of an American adult male is 180 pounds, with a standard deviation of 34 pounds. The distribution of weights follows a normal distribution. What is the probability that a man weighs exactly 185 pounds?

    -- Answer: 0 
    -- Explaination:
        -- with z-scores and probability table, we find probability P(Z<z) or P(z1 < Z < z2). 
        -- probability exactly at a point is zero.
        -- see the first answer: ( no need to read anything else on page )
