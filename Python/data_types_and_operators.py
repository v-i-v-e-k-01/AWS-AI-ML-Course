## OPERATORS

#   +, -, * , / have their regular meaning

#   ** is used for exponentiation
print(3**2)  # prints 9

#   % operator -- returns remainder after division

#   // operator -- floor division  rounds quotient to smaller integer
print(9//4) # 9/4= 2.25 -- // returns 2
print(23//8) # 23/8 = 2.87 -- // returns 2


## VARIABLE DECLARATION

# num =4
# x,y,z = 4,5,8

# variable name start with letter or underscore, name cannot be same as built in identifiers or reserved words
# try descriptive variable names 
# pythonic way to name variables is to use all lowercase letters and underscores to separate the words (called snake_case)
new_var=78

## ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS

#  += , -= , *= , /= , %= , //= have their usual meanings

# scientific notation eg.
print(4.445e8) # here 4.445e8 = 4.445*10**8

## PRACTICE QUESTION

# The current volume of a water reservoir (in cubic metres)
reservoir_volume = 4.445e8
# The amount of rainfall from a storm (in cubic metres)
rainfall = 5e6

# decrease the rainfall variable by 10% to account for runoff
rainfall*=0.9
# add the rainfall variable to the reservoir_volume variable
reservoir_volume+=rainfall
# increase reservoir_volume by 5% to account for stormwater that flows
# into the reservoir in the days following the storm
reservoir_volume*=1.05
# decrease reservoir_volume by 5% to account for evaporation
reservoir_volume*=0.95
# subtract 2.5e5 cubic metres from reservoir_volume to account for water
# that's piped to arid regions.
reservoir_volume-=2.5e5
# print the new value of the reservoir_volume variable
print(reservoir_volume) 

# answer = 447627500.0

### INTEGERS AND FLOATS

# declaration
intnum=4
floatnum=4.78
# keywords ( are not used to declare/define the data type)
# int -- for integers
# float -- for floating point values/ decimal numbers

# type() function gives data type of given variable
print( type (floatnum) )

# integer -- 387
# float -- 387. , 393.13 --with decimal
print( type(387.) )

# operation involving int & float gives float
print(3 + 2.5)

#convert data type to int -- int() function
print( int(4.78) )  # directly remove digits after decimal

#convert data type to float -- float() function
print( float(4) )  # add .0 at end

# float approximates fractional numbers eg.
num1= 1/3
print(num1)    #  1/3

# this may result in diff answers when operations are performed on float numbers
print(0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1) # gives 0.30000000000000004

#divide by zero gives ZeroDivisionError
# print(4/0)

## BEST PRACTICES IN PYTHON

#snake_case

# pythonic way to name variables is to use all lowercase letters and underscores to separate the words (called snake_case)
new_var_num=78

# add spaces 
# to lower priority operations multiple operations
print(3*7 -1+2) #here space 3*7 is higher priority


## BOOLEANS, COMPARISON & LOGICAL OPERATORS

# bool -- abbreviation for boolean value -- True/False

x = 42>48 
print(x)
# > , < , >= , <= , == , != Comparison operators have their same meaning

# and , or , not Logical Operators have their same meaning

print( 4>3 and 9>5)
print(not True )
print( 4>7 or 8<75 )

age=14
is_teen= age>12 and age<20
print(is_teen)

not_teen = not(age>12 and age<20) 


## STRINGS

# they are immutable ordered sequence pf characters

# str keyword ( not used to declare/define string)

# single and double quotes acceptable

print("Hello")
print('hello')

welcome_message=" Hello everyone"

# define string which itself contains double quotes inside it, use the single quote eg.

pet_halibut = ' Why should I be tarred whth the epithet  "loony" merely because I have a pet halibut '
print(pet_halibut)

# define string which itself contains single quote inside it like in the word you're, use  \'  ....  eg.

salesman = ' I think you\'re an encyclopedia salesman '
print(salesman)

#or
salesman=" I think you're an encyclopedia salesman "
print(salesman)

# + sign used to combine strings
str1="Hello"
str2="World"
print(str1 + " " + str2)

# * sign used to repeat strings
str3 = "## "
print(str3 * 5)

#len() function -- returns length of string 
udacity_length = len("Udacity") 
print(udacity_length)

# it is acceptable to index strings
first_word="Hello"
print(first_word[0])

#PRACTICE QUESTION

coconut_count="34"
mango_count="15"
tropical_fruit_count=coconut_count + mango_count
print(tropical_fruit_count)
print(type(tropical_fruit_count))

# We've just used the len function to find the length of strings. What does the len function return when we give it the integer 835 instead of a string?

#answer = Error 
# Nice! The error message generated reads: TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len(), which alludes to the fact that len only works on a "sequence (such as a string, bytes, tuple, list, or range) or a collection (such as a dictionary, set, or frozen set)," as per the Python documentation.

## TYPE & TYPE CONVERSION

#Conversion Functions
#int(number_here)
#float(number_here)
#str(number_here)

count = int(4.7)
print(count)

grams="35.0"
grams = float(grams)
print(type(grams))


# print("0" + 5) 
# gives error as "0" is string and 5 an integer

print(type( "hippo"*12 )) # gives string as "hippo"*12 repeats the string 12 times


## STRING METHODS

# methods -- special types of functions but unlike functions, methods are associated with specific types of objects like strings, integer etc

# there are different methods depending on type of data 

print("sebastian thrun".title())
# .title() method belong to object string
# converts first letter to uppercase

full_name = "sebastian thrun"
print(full_name.islower())

#.islower() method -- belong to object string and returns True if no character in uppercase

print("one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish.".count('fish'))

#.count('sub_string_here') -- counts number of occurences of the sub_string -- belong to object string

# print() is also a method

#.format() method 
print("Mohammed has {} balloons".format(27))
# prints --  Mohammed has 27 balloons

animal = "dog"
action = "bite"
print("Does your {} {}?".format(animal, action))

# prints --  "Does your dog bite?"

book1="Harry Potter"
book2="Helen Keller"
price1=45
price2=50
print("The books and prices are as follows {}:{}, {}:{} ".format(book1,price1,book2,price2))

book_dictionary={
    'book1':'Harry Potter',
    "book2":"Helen Keller",
    'price1':45,
    "price2":50
}

print("\n The books and prices are as follows {book1}:{price1}, {book2}:{price2} ".format(**book_dictionary)) 
# **book_list is used to put list as parameter in .format() method

#.split() method

new_str="The cow jumped over the moon"

print( new_str.split() )
# splits acc to spaces

print( new_str.split(' ',3) )
# here separator is space i.e. ' '
# maximum splits set to 3

print( new_str.split(None,3) )
# None -- means no separator, thus by default, space is used as separator
